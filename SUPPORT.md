# Getting Help

**We're here to help!** 🙏

If this repo has discussions enabled, using discussions is a good way to reach other developers on this repo and solicit their help.

Otherwise, the best way to get help from the broader Protective community is to use [plOverflow](https://github.com/orgs/protective-emerging-tech/discussions).  Make sure to check out its [guidelines](https://github.com/protective-emerging-tech/discussions#readme) prior to starting a new discussion.

> **Note**:
> Take a few minutes to consider the following before starting a discussion:
> * [Talk to a duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)!
> * Don't fall for the [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378)
